          <p>The magnificent tiger, Panthera tigris is a striped animal. It has a thick yellow coat of fur with dark stripes. The combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power has earned the tiger its pride of place as the national animal of India. Out of eight races of the species known, the Indian race, the Royal Bengal Tiger, is found throughout the country except in the north-western region and also in the neighbouring countries, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. To check the dwindling population of tigers in India, 'Project Tiger' was launched in April 1973. So far, 27 tiger reserves have been established in the country under this project, covering an area of 37,761 sq km.</p>

            <h1>About India</h1>
  
            <p>
              India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a
              kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved
              all-round socio-economic progress since Independence. As the 7th
              largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of
              Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the
              country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great
              Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of
              Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal
              on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
