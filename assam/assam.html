                     A Quintessential Assamese Thali or Platter
                    A traditional Assamese meal begins with a "khar", a class of dishes named after the main ingredient, and ends with a "tenga", a sour dish. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils which are believed to be good for health and boosting up immunity. The most common dessert would be a rice pudding called "Payash". "Poitabhat" is a favourite dish in Assam during the summer season. Cooked rice is soaked overnight and left to ferment. It is served with mustard oil, onion, chili, pickles, pitika etc.
